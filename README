CoordinaTeX is a script which will assist the creation of TeX documents in
several fashions:

1) It will automatically compile the TeX document when it changes, and if the
compilation is successful it will tell the reader to refresh the document.
If your editor is set to update sufficiently often, the effect should be to
get a somewhat live update of the TeX document as it is being created.

2) It will attempt to poll the text editor for the cursor position, and - if
synctex or srctex is enabled - it will "forward-search"; that is, it will
have the reader move to the appropriate part of the document.  If you are
editing at the end of the document and jump to the beginning, the reader
should also jump to the first page with you.

3) Where possible, it will attempt to support reverse-searches as well; that
is, the reader can tell the editor to jump to a position.  If you tell the
reader you want to reverse-search to the line that created the title
information, the editor will jump to \maketitle.

4) Should a compilation error arise, CoordinaTeX will update the contents of
the reader with the TeX error information (as far as I know, this feature is
unique to CoordinaTeX).

5) If CoordinaTeX is not handed sufficient information directly, it will
attempt to intelligently guess the missing options.  If only one ".tex"
document appears in the directory CoordinaTeX is run in, only one ".pdf" or
".dvi" file exists in that directory, only one editor is running, and only
one reader is running, CoordinaTeX will guess these options.

Moreover, CoordinaTeX will attempt to do these things in a flexible,
extendable manner; if a given editor, output format or reader is not
supported it should be easy to add it. (Feel free to upstream the additions
back!)

* Currently supported editors:
	- vim
* Currently supported TeX compilation options:
	- latex with srcltx to DVI
	- latex with synctex to PDF
* Currently supported readers:
	- xdvi
	- xpdf
	- mupdf

Eventually I'd like to add several more editors, readers and formats.


 How to use (at the moment):
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

1. Ensure you are using LaTeX, not Plain TeX or ConTeXt.
2. Open the document in Vim  with a server name
	(e.g.: vim --servername vimtex filename.tex)
	(You can check the servername once in vim via :echo v:servername)
3. Run coordinatex.  (See coordinatex -h for arguments)
4. When you're done, switch to coordinatex and hit ctrl-c

 To do:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

- Figure out how to poll for cursor position in other editors
	- emacs
	- gedit
	- joe
- Figure out how to at least forward search page in other output readers
	- Evince supports synctex?
	- mupdf?
	- xpdf?
	- KDE's DVI/PDF reader(s)?
		- Ocular
		- KDVI supports srcltx?
	- Adobe's reader?
	- Mac-specific reader? (Preview?)
	- BSD-specific reader?
	- Solaris-specific reader?
- Heavily comment source code
- Support handling non-main/inputted TeX files
- Support TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt with all of their supported output formats
	- PostScript?
	- DVI, via srcltx, or other things?
	- PDF, via synctex, or other things?
- Maybe auto-detect as much as possible?
	- Find main .tex file
		- May require a comment in the handed .tex filename
		- May grep through local files for \input{FILENAME}
	- Find which command to use to compile
		- If it contains \documentclass{*}, it's probably (PDF)LaTeX
			- If it contains \usepackage{srcltx}, it's probably DVI, else PDF?
		- If it contains \bye, it's probably (PDF)TeX
		- Forgot what ConTeXt uses, figure that out
	- Check environmental variables
		- $PDFREADER
	- Make a config?
		- ./.coordinatex
		- ~/.coordinatex
- Recommended editor settings
	- vim
		- binding to start/stop coordinatex updating
	- other editors
