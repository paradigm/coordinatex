CoordinaTeX is a script intended to help the coordination between a text
editor and dvi/pdf reader in the creation of TeX documents.  Specifically:

1) It will automatically compile the TeX document when it changes, and if the
compilation is successful it will tell the reader to refresh the document.
If your editor is set to update sufficiently often, the effect should be to
get a somewhat live update of the TeX document as it is being created.

2) It will attempt to automate srctex/synctex's forward searching, where it
can.  Forward searching is where the reader jumps to the position in the
pdf/dvi corresponding to a position in the source.  For example, if the
editor's cursor moves from the end of the document to the beginning, the
dvi/pdf reader will jump to the first page.

3) Where possible, it will attempt to support reverse-searches as well; that
is, the reader can tell the editor to jump to a position.  If you tell the
reader you want to reverse-search to the line that created the title
information, the editor will jump to \maketitle.

4) Should a compilation error arise, CoordinaTeX will update the contents of
the reader with the TeX error information (as far as I know, this feature is
unique to CoordinaTeX).

5) If CoordinaTeX is not handed sufficient information directly, it will
attempt to intelligently guess the missing options.  If only one ".tex"
document appears in the directory CoordinaTeX is run in, only one ".pdf" or
".dvi" file exists in that directory, only one editor is running, and only
one reader is running, CoordinaTeX will guess these options.

Moreover, CoordinaTeX will attempt to do these things in a flexible,
extendable manner; if a given editor, output format or reader is not
supported it should be easy to add it.
