CoordinaTeX is a shell script which automates coordination between a TeX editor
and the program which views its output.  The idea is to get something close to
a live update of what the TeX document looks like while editing it.

Currently supported:

	- Editors: Vim (with +clientserver)
	- Output readers: xdvi
	- Output formats: LaTeX with srcltx

Eventually I'd like to add several more editors, readers and formats.

 How to use (at the moment):
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

1. Ensure your LaTeX document uses the srcltx package, \usepackage{srcltx}
2. Open the document in Vim  with a server name
	(e.g.: vim --servername vimtex filename.tex)
	2b. You can check the servername once in vim via :echo v:servername<CR>
3. Run coordinatex.  (See coordinatex -h for arguments)
4. When you're done, switch to coordinatex and hit ENTER (or ctrl-c)

 To do:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

- Figure out how to poll for cursor position in other editors
	- emacs
	- gedit
	- joe
- Figure out how to at least forward search page in other output readers
	- Evince supports synctex?
	- mupdf?
	- xpdf?
	- KDE's DVI/PDF reader(s)?
		- Ocular
		- KDVI supports srcltx?
	- Adobe's reader?
	- Mac-specific reader? (Preview?)
	- BSD-specific reader?
	- Solaris-specific reader?
- Windows stuff?
	- Cygwin?
	- Batch script?
	- Powershell?
- Heavily comment source code
- Support handling non-main/inputted TeX files
- Support TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt with all of their supported output formats
	- PostScript?
	- DVI, via srcltx, or other things?
	- PDF, via synctex, or other things?
- Maybe auto-detect as much as possible?
	- Find main .tex file
		- May require a comment in the handed .tex filename
		- May grep through local files for \input{FILENAME}
	- Find which command to use to compile
		- If it contains \documentclass{*}, it's probably (PDF)LaTeX
			- If it contains \usepackage{srcltx}, it's probably DVI, else PDF?
		- If it contains \bye, it's probably (PDF)TeX
		- Forgot what ConTeXt uses, figure that out
	- Check environmental variables
		- $PDFREADER
	- Make a config?
		- ./.coordinatex
		- ~/.coordinatex
- Recommended editor settings
	- vim
		- binding to start/stop coordinatex updating
	- other editors
