Coordinatex is a simple handful of bourne shell scripts to automate coordination between a TeX editor and the program which views its output.  The idea is to get something close to a live update of what the TeX document looks like while editing it.

Eventually I'd like to get support for both multiple editors as well as multiple DVI and PDF viewers, srcltx and synctex.

This is quite an early alpha.  It kinda works for my purposes at the moment.
